Hello and welcome to my project. This is a ASP.NET Core API, SQLite, and Angular project that displays a database of people with some information and an image. Starting with the API the project will need to be run from the Visual Studio environment with the IIS configuation. The Angular service may then be run using the ng serve command in the terminal. If you then navigate to the localhost:port that the terminal sets up you will find the page displaying all the people currently in the database. There is also the option to add more people as well as search the list by name. The seach function is designed to simulate a slow responce and display a simple loading screen to let the user know that the action is working. Thank you for taking the time to look at my project.
